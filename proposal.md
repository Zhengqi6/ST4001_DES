**Literature Review**

**Introduction**

The integration of distributed energy systems with low-carbon optimization has been an imperative area of study in the backdrop of the world facing the issue of energy transition and climate change. The application of carbon pricing with tax and trading schemes has the primary scope of affecting the operation and planning of DES. The review synthesizes the revised findings of optimization of DES with carbon pricing and emphasizes the application of carbon option pricing as a new analytical technique to aid low-carbon energy systems.

**Background and Research Motivation**

The global carbon-neutrality push has promoted the use of carbon price and incentive schemes of the consumption of renewable energy. The employment of distributed energy systems that include sources of the renewable energy, energy storages, and demand management has been crucial in the realization of low-carbon ambitions. Optimization of such systems against carbon price volatility and the behavior of the market has been an issue.

The Role of Carbon Option Pricing

Carbon option price, a carbon price hedging derivative funding carbon price hedging, allows stakeholders to hedge against carbon price volatility. Integration of carbon option price into DES optimization forms a promising direction toward economic and environment optimization goals.

**Current Research Fields**

**Research direction and current progress in the field**

The study also elucidates that the optimization framework of DES has been developed into a system with economic, environment and technical parameters in conception. For example, a review of distributed energy system planning, modeling, optimization and control states a framework of optimization with multiple economic, environment and technical parameters' objectives. Balance investment planning and operation management of DES with the synergy of energy efficiency and power options. The study also elucidates that carbon pricing instruments such as carbon tax and emissions trading schemes are integrated into optimization models in an effort of giving a price tag of carbon emissions. For example, Low-carbon optimal operation of distributed energy systems with power supply constraint and carbon tax policy investigates low-carbon optimization with power supply constraint and carbon tax policy with an emphasis of how carbon tax incentivize low-carbon dispatch. Real options theory has also developed the use of energy systems with a specific application in the use of carbon price uncertainty. The critical review of Real Options thinking for valuation of investment flexibility in Smart Grids and low carbon energy systems elucidates how real options provide decision flexibilities of low-carbon energy systems with a specific application in the field of smart grids and renewable sources of energy. The study also elucidates that Assessing the effects of CO2 price caps on electricity investments - A real options analysis Assessing the effects of CO2 price caps on electricity investments - a real options analysis The carbon price volatility effect on investment decision-making is the area of study with a focus.

Distributed Energy Systems Optimization

Research is mainly concentrated in the following directions:

Hu et al(2024) proposed a multi-objective bi-layer planning framework of integrated energy systems that incorporate electric heating with the aim of maximizing economic efficiency and system stability with the inclusion of energy storage systems (Hu et al., 2024). Hao et al. proposed a framework of multi-objective optimization that seeks to optimize investment planning and operation of district energy systems (DES), with the inclusion of energy efficiency and supply options in order to allow comprehensive planning (Hao et al., 2022). Furthermore, carbon pricing tools such as carbon tax and emissions trading schemes are highly embedded in optimization models in order to quantify the economic effect of carbon emissions (Zhang et al., 2023). Chen et al. proposed an optimal energy management strategy that incorporates a firm against uncertainties of renewable energy sources and the demand of the load with the use of flexible uncertainty sets. An innovative statistical index has been developed to quantify the effectiveness of the robust optimization strategy and therefore the highest economic expenditure and least environment pollution effect (Chen et al., 2021).

Carbon Option Pricing

1. Seifert et al.(2011) proposed a dynamic carbon pricing framework that integrated option price methods with price volatility factors in 2008. Feng et al. (2011) analyzed the factors influencing carbon pricing in the EU ETS and emphasized the need for analyzing carbon options against the backdrop of volatility in the market. Koch and Bassen (2013) had a thorough analysis of how the distribution of carbon emission permits affects the economic benefit accrued to energy companies.

2. Schachter et al. proposed a dynamic carbon pricing framework that seeks to maximize the use of option pricing with the addition of price volatility (Schachter & Mancarella, 2016). Szolgayova et al., in their study, assessed the effect of a carbon price limit on investment in the power sector and the significance of carbon price volatility with regard to long-term investment planning (Szolgayova et al., 2008).

**Existing Problems and/or Obstacles**

The advancement of Distributed Energy Systems has a lot of barriers that include system complexities, carbon price uncertainties, limited availability of integrated carbon financing instruments and the limitations identified in the literature.

The complexity of the system is mainly due to the interaction of multiple energy sources, storage systems and demand profiles, which significantly increases the computational difficulty of the optimization model. Twaha and Ramli (2018) point out that the distributed storage and renewable energy integration of DES need to effectively solve the problem of supply-demand imbalance. Uncertainty about the price of carbon further complicates long-term planning and investment decisions (Zhu et al., 2023). The robust energy management approach proposed by Chen et al. (2021)

. Zhang et al., (2013) mostly focused on single objective optimization of economic or environmental benefits, failing to effectively balance the two (D. Zhang et al., 2013).

**Prospective** **in the research field**

**Improved Uncertainty modeling Uncertainty in distributed energy systems**

3.1.1 Subsequent studies will study more specific methods of hybrid uncertainty simulation that include hybrid models that incorporate Markov chains, scenario generation and optimization stochastics with the intention of simulating carbon price variation and carbon price dynamics. Awan et al. (2020) showed that the volatility of carbon prices is highly dependent on energy price volatility and a change of policy that calls for the use of complex models in depicting them (Awan et al., 2020).

**Deep integration of carbon options**

3.2.1 Carbon options, a particular category of financial tools, play a critical role in the optimization and timing of the operation processes of dispersed power systems. The tools allow flexible carbon emission management strategies within the power network and the microgrid schemes. Future study activities might be focused on the following directions:

Carmona and Hinz' carbon option price model forms a conceptual basis of the management of risk within the decision-making processes of dispersed power; however, it has not been fully examined with respect to practical application (Carmona & Hinz, 2011). The effect of carbon financial tools on clean energy investment has been examined by Ahmad et al., providing useful findings with respect to the use of carbon options in the power sector (Ahmad et al., 2018).

Efficient distributed optimization algorithm

3.3.1 The expanding application of distributed energy systems goes alongside an appreciable boost in the computational intensity of optimization processes. Future study will be directed toward the improvement of the effectiveness of distributed optimization methods such as neighborhood multiplier techniques, distributed random optimization methods, and techniques based on the use of deep reinforcement training with the intention of improving the optimization efficiency of large distributed energy systems. The optimization algorithm based on the neighboring multiplier technique proposed by Silani et al. (2019) appreciably reduces the computational intensity of the optimization of distributed energy systems (Silani & Yazdanpanah, 2019). The use of distributed algorithms also simplifies the cooperative optimization of numerous area systems and at the same time reduces the computational burden (Alavi et al., 2008).

**Project Proposal**

**Research Background**

The rising need to battle against climate change and transition toward a low-carbon economy has prompted the development of new methods within the energy system. Localized power generation technologies that incorporate green sources of power such as the sun and the wind have been identified as a critical strategy toward reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and general energy efficiency improvement. The distributed power systems also present challenges associated with the variability of the generation of power based on the sun and the wind and with the volatility of the energy market.

Carbon pricing schemes such as carbon trading and carbon taxation have been widely adopted with the intention of curbing emissions and encouraging industries to adopt cleaner technologies. Among the schemes has been the use of carbon options—derivatives that allow organizations to hedge against price volatility of carbon—bringing with them clear economic benefits of hedging against carbon price uncertainties. The use of carbon option pricing within Demand Side Management systems has the potential of bringing operational efficiency, reducing emissions and aligning with the world’s carbon-neutality goals.

This study explores the intersection of carbon option pricing and DES, focusing on developing a comprehensive optimization framework. By addressing both environmental and economic objectives, this research aims to contribute to sustainable energy system design and provide actionable insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders.

**Introduction to the research fields**

The shift toward a low carbon economy has emphasized the need to move the use of distributed energy systems (DES) and carbon price mechanisms faster, and they play a critical role in the global effort against climate change. DES that use dispersed sources of energy including the sun and the wind and the use of energy storages help mitigate the emission of green houses and enhance the world's energy security. The inclusion of the dispersed sources of energy poses operational uncertainties that hinder the optimization of energy sources effectively (Liu, 2019).

The effectiveness of such mechanisms has been proven in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) environment in which carbon price-sensitive instruments drive emission-cutting strategies and patterns of trading behavior (Rabaza et al., n.d.).

**Aim and Significance of the proposal**

The primary motive of this proposed study includes the design of the carbon option price strategies based distributed energy system with a low-carbon optimization framework. The study seeks the design of a stable decision framework that not only saves operation expenditure and carbon emissions but also ensures the sustainability of the energy system with the simultaneous resolution of the carbon price volatility and the uncertainties of the sources of the sources of the sources of the renewable sources of energy. The scope of the study includes

Development of an option price of carbon that considers the carbon price volatility and the changing regulations implicitly.Integration of carbon monetary instruments into the optimization procedures of DES and the economic and environmental tradeoffs that they present. Analysis of the effectiveness of this integration through simulation tests performed based on different market and operational scenarios.

The significance of this proposal lies in the fact that it has the capacity to fill critical shortcomings of existing advances in optimization techniques of low-carbon energy systems. Traditional DES optimization models often neglect the economic uncertainties of the carbon price volatility. The study proposes an original solution with the dual intention of alleviating such uncertainties while reducing optimization costs at the same time. This combination of the two facets of the study is expected to realize major contributions that

Pragmatic Considerations for Policymakers and Stakeholders

The results of the study will help policymakers and stakeholders in the industry identify the importance of carbon financial instruments in carbon-neutrality initiatives. Through the presentation of the economic and environmental benefits linked with carbon option pricing, the study argues that the development of better regulations in the carbon market be established.

Advancements in methods of energy optimization.

This study extends the field of energy optimization with the inclusion of carbon financial instruments in multi-objective optimization models. The framework that has been proposed reconciles the dual goals of emission abatement and economic efficiency and offers a general framework for the design of low-carbon energy systems.

The current study seeks to integrate the crossing of carbon instruments with the optimization of dispersed power systems and outline a new and practical framework that ensures the realization of economic and environment-friendly energy options.
