# Future Enhancements Roadmap

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the Low-Carbon Distributed Energy System Optimization project, based on our discussions and the long-term vision in `ST4001.md`.

## 1. Enhancing Data Infrastructure & Automation

The goal is to move from manually configured/simplified data inputs to a more automated and robust data pipeline connected to real-world data sources.

*   **Automated Data Acquisition:**
    *   **NREL Data:**
        *   Implement Python scripts to fetch solar irradiance (NSRDB PSM3 API) and wind data (WIND Toolkit API) for specific locations and timeframes.
        *   Automate fetching load profiles (ResStock/ComStock via OpenEI API).
        *   Integrate fetching of technology parameters from NREL ATB reports (e.g., by parsing or API if available).
    *   **Carbon Market Data:**
        *   Explore options for accessing historical carbon spot/futures prices (e.g., EUA from ICE, EEX). This might involve investigating free tiers of financial data APIs or, if necessary, paid services.
        *   Similarly, investigate sources for carbon option market data.
    *   **Financial Data:**
        *   Automate fetching of risk-free interest rates from sources like central bank databases (e.g., FRED API).
*   **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning Pipeline:**
    *   Develop robust scripts for:
        *   Timezone conversion and alignment across different datasets.
        *   Handling missing data (imputation strategies).
        *   Outlier detection and treatment.
        *   Unit conversion and standardization.
        *   Resampling data to consistent time resolutions.
*   **Data Version Control (DVC):**
    *   Implement DVC to manage large datasets, ensuring reproducibility of experiments when data sources are updated.
    *   Define DVC pipelines for data ingestion and preprocessing steps.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Organize raw and processed data into a clear directory structure (e.g., `data/raw/nrel/`, `data/processed/solar_profiles/`).
    *   Utilize efficient storage formats like Parquet for large time-series datasets.
*   **Integration with Core Models:**
    *   Modify `run_case_study.py` and data preparation utilities to consume these automatically fetched and processed datasets.

## 2. Implementing Advanced Models & Algorithms

This involves upgrading the complexity and realism of the core analytical modules, as envisioned in `ST4001.md`.

*   **Carbon Price Modeling (`carbon_pricer`):**
    *   Implement more sophisticated stochastic processes beyond GARCH/GBM:
        *   Jump-Diffusion models (e.g., Merton) to capture price shocks.
        *   Regime-Switching models for structural breaks (e.g., policy changes).
        *   Stochastic Volatility models (e.g., Heston) for more realistic volatility dynamics.
    *   Explore advanced forecasting techniques, potentially hybrid models (e.g., GARCH-LSTM).
*   **Financial Option Pricing (`financial_option_pricer`):**
    *   Implement pricing models consistent with advanced carbon price processes (e.g., Heston model option pricing, Merton model option pricing).
    *   Consider extensions to Black-Scholes like SKM or MLN-2 if simpler models are insufficient.
    *   If necessary, implement numerical methods like Monte Carlo for complex/exotic options.
*   **DES Optimization (`des_optimizer`):**
    *   Explore MINLP formulations if key non-linearities are critical.
    *   Investigate stochastic programming approaches for multi-stage operational planning under uncertainty.
    *   For multi-agent scenarios, consider implementing game-theoretic models (e.g., MPEC, bi-level optimization using Pyomo extensions).
*   **Real Option Analysis (`real_option_analyzer`):**
    *   Implement alternative ROA valuation methods like Monte Carlo simulation for more complex options or path-dependencies.
    *   Explore multi-objective ROA if investments need to balance economic and environmental criteria explicitly within the ROA framework.
*   **Decision Controller (`decision_controller`):**
    *   Move towards more integrated optimization for operational hedging, such as:
        *   Bi-level optimization (DES operation ऊपरी स्तर, hedging decision निचला स्तर).
        *   Integrated stochastic programming models for joint DES operation and hedging.
    *   Develop more sophisticated rules or optimization for strategic investment decisions based on ROA and other factors.

## 3. Establishing Comprehensive Testing & Validation

To ensure robustness, reliability, and credibility of the research outcomes.

*   **Unit Testing:**
    *   Implement comprehensive unit tests for all core functions and classes within each module using `pytest` or `unittest`.
    *   Focus on testing individual logic, boundary conditions, and error handling.
*   **Integration Testing:**
    *   Develop tests to verify the interaction and data flow between different modules (e.g., `carbon_pricer` output fed into `financial_option_pricer`).
*   **System-Level Testing:**
    *   Design end-to-end test scenarios that run the full case study with known inputs and expected (or benchmarked) outputs.
*   **Validation Strategies (as per `ST4001.md` Section V):**
    *   **Financial Models (`carbon_pricer`, `financial_option_pricer`):**
        *   Back-testing against historical market data.
        *   Replication of stylized market facts (volatility clustering, smile/skew).
        *   Comparison with benchmark models.
    *   **DES Optimizer (`des_optimizer`):**
        *   Internal consistency checks (energy balance, constraint satisfaction).
        *   Comparison with benchmark DES cases or established tools (e.g., REopt Lite for simplified scenarios).
        *   Sensitivity analysis on key parameters.
    *   **ROA Analyzer (`real_option_analyzer`):**
        *   Theoretical consistency checks.
        *   Sensitivity analysis on option values and investment thresholds.
        *   Comparison with traditional NPV.
    *   **Integrated System & Decision Logic (`decision_controller`):**
        *   Robustness testing across diverse scenarios.
        *   Qualitative validation by domain experts.
        *   Quantitative comparison of strategies (e.g., hedge vs. no hedge, ROA vs. NPV).
*   **Documentation for Test Cases:**
    *   Document the purpose, setup, and expected outcomes for all significant test cases.

This roadmap provides a structured approach to enhancing the project's capabilities and rigor over time. Priorities can be adjusted based on research needs and findings.
